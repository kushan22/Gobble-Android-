# Gobble-Android-
MIT Slone and Google Hackthon App (Finalists)

Me and my team developed an Android Application for providing recommendations based on the reviews,preferences,dislikes
and considerations from a group of friends who are going out to eat. Based on their previous data our Machine Learning model
predicts restaurants and also gives food recommendations. Our idea got selected as top 5 ideas and we went to Google's Cambridge office to demo our product.
